// MARK: - Sort orders

/// Sort order for `allTracks(sortedBy:)` / `allTracksDisplay(sortedBy:)`. Every order is
/// realised in SQL by `trackOrder(_:prefix:)` (one definition site, so the bare-`tracks`
/// and JOINed-Display reads can never drift) and ALWAYS ends in `id` as the final unique
/// tiebreaker, so a collision on the primary key yields a fully deterministic order.
///
/// `Hashable` so `trackOrder` can classify the descending variants by set membership.
///
/// The S9.5 (D7) additions serve the rich sortable Songs table. Nulls-ordering is EXPLICIT
/// and documented per case below; the JOINed artist/album **name** sorts
/// (`artistAlbumTrack`, `albumTitle*`) reference the Display reads' `ar`/`al` join aliases
/// and are therefore valid ONLY on the LEFT-JOINed Display reads — the bare `tracks` reads
/// use only the column-based sorts.
