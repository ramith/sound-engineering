// MARK: - Lock-free Double Buffer

/// A pair of Float arrays swapped via a generation counter.
/// The producer (audio thread) writes into the "back" slot; increments
/// the counter when done. The consumer (main thread) reads the slot
/// whose index matches the latest counter.
///
/// Safety: both slots are pre-allocated at init. No allocation ever
/// occurs in `write(_:)` or `read(into:)`.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` invariant: this is a single-producer/single-consumer (SPSC)
/// lock-free handoff. `write(_:)` is called ONLY from the audio tap thread (the sole
/// writer); `read(into:)` is called ONLY from the MainActor (the sole reader). Both
/// `slots` are pre-sized at `init` and NEVER reallocated — they are only overwritten
/// in place via `withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer`. Cross-thread coordination is the
/// wrapping `publishedGeneration` counter, published via an aligned `Int` store
/// (single-instruction, atomic on arm64 for aligned 64-bit stores). No lock or queue
/// is ever taken on either side; adding one would put synchronization on the RT writer
/// (priority-inversion risk) — forbidden. This is the actual RT→UI boundary, so an
/// audited `@unchecked Sendable` is the correct tool here.
