// MARK: - AudioEngineBridge Enhanced-path gapless engine

/// Implements the three gapless protocol requirements (`setNextTrack`, `trackTransitionCount`,
/// `playbackEnded`) for the Enhanced path (AVAudioEngine + streaming resampler).
///
/// ## Architecture overview
///
/// Two sub-paths exist on the Enhanced path, and gapless is handled differently for each:
///
/// **Resampler sub-path** (file rate ≠ 48 kHz, driven by `AudioEngineBridge+EnhancedResampler`):
///   The `onResamplerEOF` hook is installed on `resampleQueue` after `startEnhancedResampler`
///   succeeds. When the resampler's completion chain reaches end-of-file it fires the hook (still
///   on `resampleQueue`). If a next track is armed, `rollResamplerToNext` opens the new file,
///   builds a NEW `AVAudioConverter`, and calls `startEnhancedResampler` without stopping the
///   player — the buffer queue stays contiguous → gap-free.
///
/// **Passthrough sub-path** (48 kHz file, `scheduleFile`):
///   `playFile` schedules the file with `completionCallbackType: .dataPlayedBack` and dispatches
///   onto `resampleQueue` when the hardware finishes playing the last sample. `onPassthroughEOF`
///   fires there. If a next track is armed and it is also 48 kHz → `scheduleFile` the new file
///   immediately (consecutive schedules play back-to-back, byte-exact); if the next track is a
///   different rate → `startEnhancedResampler` for it without stopping the player.
///
/// ## Thread model
///
/// All gapless state (`onDeckURL`, `gaplessTransitionCount`, `gaplessPlaybackEnded`,
/// `onResamplerEOF`, `onPassthroughEOF`) is read and written exclusively on `resampleQueue`
/// (the same serial queue that owns all resampler/converter state). The protocol methods
/// `setNextTrack`, `trackTransitionCount`, and `playbackEnded` marshal onto `resampleQueue`
/// via `async` or `sync` to honour this invariant. The VM polls the counter/flag at 20 Hz from
/// `DispatchQueue.main`; `resampleQueue.sync` in the read path is instantaneous (the queue is
/// never held under a slow operation when a protocol read arrives).
///
/// ## Gapless AAC/MP3 note
///
/// `AVAudioFile` / `ExtAudioFile` automatically trims AAC priming silence and MP3 LAME delay/
/// padding (via the file's edit list and `kExtAudioFileProperty_ClientDataFormat`). This is
/// Apple's responsibility on the Enhanced path; we must not disable or override it. The explicit
/// FFmpeg-path trim (for the Pure path) is Stage 2.
